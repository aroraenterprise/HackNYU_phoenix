    <h2>What it does</h2>

    <p>VOICE[H]OVER works much like the head mounted laser and print out, but is notably different because of its ability to
      export inputs into a .txt file that can be read by a Python code that will speak with natural language. When used effectively,
      it can be used to eliminate the necessity of help from others. It is unlike other options of this technology because
      it is affordable and only needs a computer with a webcam. </p>

    <h2>How we built it</h2>

    <p>We built VOICE[H]OVER primarily using Processing and an Open CV to track the laser. This program then converts the inputs
      into a .txt file that can be read by a Python Script attached to natural language processing.</p>

    <h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>

    <p>Although we worked tirelessly to include completed options of eye tracking and predictive text, we could not get this
      into the final state. To show our development, however, we included this code as well, so you can see the progress
      we made. We even have a fun, though challenging, eye tracking game you can try! </p>

    <h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>

    <p>We are proud that our friendship is still in tact ;) and that we were able to get as far as we could when we didn't think
      even half of this was possible.</p>

    <h2>What we learned</h2>

    <p>Don't think too big. Focus on the main goal and take it step by step. Know what goals are stretches and what is more
      realistic. </p>

    <h2>What's next for VoiceHover</h2>

    <p>To include data stability, eye tracking, predictive text, and an overall better design. </p> -->
